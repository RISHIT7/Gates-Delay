## Introduction

In digital circuits, delay refers to the time it takes for a signal to propagate from one point to another. The Gates-Delay project focuses on creating a delay circuit using logic gates, which can be useful in various applications such as synchronization, clock generation, and signal processing.

## Installation

To use the Gates-Delay project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RISHIT7/Gates-Delay.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory: 
```bash
cd Gates-Delay
```

## Usage

To use the Gates-Delay circuit, follow these steps:

1. Run with system argument A for gates delay.
2. Run with system argument B for Required initial delays.
